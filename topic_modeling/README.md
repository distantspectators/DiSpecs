## Description:
Jupyter Notebook series developed in the course of the project Distant Spectators - Distant Reading for Periodicals of the Enlightenment for analyzing the corpus of the Spectators using Topic Modeling. The series contains Notebooks for evaluation and visualization (notebooks 1, 2, and 2b), preparatory steps (notebooks 3 and 4), and modeling of text files incl. tokenization and the creation of the document term matrix (notebook 5), as well as visualizing of the topic modeling results (notebook 6). The code for Topic Modeling is based on the Topics Notebooks developed by DARIAH-DE. The notebooks are no longer being maintained since 2021.
